# Distributed Taxi Management System 🚖

A C++ project that simulates a **ride-hailing platform** with drivers, passengers, and administrators.  
The system is implemented using **object-oriented programming, client–server architecture, and a Qt-based GUI**.

## 📌 Features

### Phase 1 – Command-Line System
- Implemented a CLI-based taxi booking platform.  
- Supported **user registration** (drivers, passengers, admins).  
- Integrated **trip requests, payments, driver ratings, and reporting**.  
- Designed **algorithms** for trip cost estimation, shortest path calculation, and driver selection.  

### Phase 2 – Client–Server Architecture
- Built a **central server** with separate **driver and passenger clients**.  
- Implemented **network communication** between clients and the server.  
- Added support for **admin operations** (e.g., verifying drivers, system reports).  
- Ensured modular, scalable, and maintainable design.  

### Phase 3 – Qt Graphical User Interface
- Developed a **cross-platform GUI** using **Qt** for drivers and passengers.  
- Implemented **real-time updates** for trip cost/distance estimation.  
- Designed GUI components for **login, registration, account management, and trip status**.  
- Integrated **business logic from earlier phases** into the GUI for clean architecture.
